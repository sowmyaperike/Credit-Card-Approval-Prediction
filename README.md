# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a credit card application will be **approved** or **rejected** using Machine Learning algorithms. The system analyzes applicant information such as income, age, family members, employment years, and other financial details to make predictions.

The best-performing model is integrated into a **Flask web application**, allowing users to enter applicant details and receive an instant prediction.
